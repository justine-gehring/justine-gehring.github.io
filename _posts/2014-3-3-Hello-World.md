title: A little about me
---
I am in my final year of my masters at Mila & McGill under the supervision of [Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/) and [Danny Tarlow](https://research.google/people/DannyTarlow/). I originally became interrested in AI due to absolutely loving any problem having to do with graphs. This paved the way to me working on ML for code. Through the years I have gained knowledge on using transformers and graph neural nets. Particulalrly I focus on the problem of generating code based on a prompt which is library specific. I am presently looking for an internship or full time employment for spring 2023 and/or summer 2023.
