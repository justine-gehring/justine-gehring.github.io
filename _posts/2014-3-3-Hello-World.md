title: A little about me
---
I am in my final year of my masters at McGill under the supervision of Jin Guo{https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/} and Danny Tarlow{https://research.google/people/DannyTarlow/}. I originally became interrested in AI due to absolutely loving any problem having to do with graphs. This paved the way to me working on ML for code. Through the years I have gained knowledge on using transformers and graph neural nets. Particulalrly I focus on the problem of generating code based on a human prompt which is library specific. I am presently looking for an internship or full time employment for when I finish my masters in mid spring.
