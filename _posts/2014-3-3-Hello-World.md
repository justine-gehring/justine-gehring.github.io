title: A little about me
---
I am in my final year of my masters at Mila & McGill under the supervision of [Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/) and [Danny Tarlow](https://research.google/people/DannyTarlow/). It was my interest in graphs that first brought AI research to my attention. This paved the way to my work on ML for code and graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the years, I have specialized in using transformers and graph neural nets on the problem of generating code. Specifically, my current research focuses on library specific code in the context of sparse data. I am presently looking for an internship or full time employment for spring 2023 and/or summer 2023.
