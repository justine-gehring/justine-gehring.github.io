I am in my final year of my masters at Mila & McGill under the supervision of [Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/) and [Danny Tarlow](https://research.google/people/DannyTarlow/). It was my interest in graphs that first brought AI research to my attention. This paved the way to my work on ML for code and graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the years, I have specialized in using transformers and graph neural nets on the problem of generating code. Specifically, my current research focuses on library specific code in the context of sparse data. I am presently looking for an internship or full time employment for spring 2023 and/or summer 2023. 

### CV

### Groups I'm in
I took over the ML4Code reading group at Mila for the year 2022-2023. We meet bi-weekly and if we don't have a special guest, we dicuss a paper that caught our eye. Over the summer I took a temporary position as the PGSS representative for the Computer Science Graduate Society (CSGS) at McGill. I helped out on various projects some social, some designing, and some administrative.

### Outside of work
As a true Montreal native, I play hockey once a week and enjoy watching the habs. Like many, during the covid quarantine I picked up extra hobies. However,  the only one to have really stuck is sewing. I enjoy tracing my own patterns and playing around tailoring ill-fitting clothes.
