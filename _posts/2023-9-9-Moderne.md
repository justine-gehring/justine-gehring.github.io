I'm thrilled to have joined Moderne in May 2023 as a research engineer. My primary goal is to drive the integration of machine learning techniques into Moderne's pipeline, revolutionizing how we approach code refactoring at scale.
With my expertise in machine learning and software engineering, I'm passionate about leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to enhance Moderne's capabilities. My focus is on developing innovative solutions, offering valuable benchmarks and metrics to measure the effectiveness of our code refactoring processes.
At Moderne, we specialize in automatic code refactoring on a large scale. Our mission is to assist organizations in modernizing their code, eliminating vulnerabilities, and introducing necessary changes to their codebases. With the aid of our groundbreaking tool, OpenRewrite, we can efficiently analyze and refactor code, significantly improving its quality, maintainability, and performance.
By collaborating with a dedicated team of experts at Moderne, I'm excited to contribute to the development of new tools that will shape the future of software engineering. Together, we aim to revolutionize the way codebases are transformed, ensuring they are robust, secure, and aligned with the latest industry standards.
