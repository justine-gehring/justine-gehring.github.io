I'm thrilled to have joined [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/) in May 2023 as a research engineer.At Moderne, we specialize in automatic code refactoring on a large scale. Our mission is to assist organizations in modernizing their code, eliminating vulnerabilities, and introducing necessary changes to their codebases. With the aid of our tool, OpenRewrite, we can efficiently analyze and refactor code, significantly improving its quality and maintainability. We aim to revolutionize the way codebases are transformed, ensuring they are robust, secure, and aligned with the latest industry standards. My primary goal is to drive the integration of machine learning techniques into Moderne's pipeline, revolutionizing how we approach code refactoring at scale.
