### About me

I am in my final year of my masters at Mila & McGill under the supervision of [Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/) and [Danny Tarlow](https://research.google/people/DannyTarlow/). I originally became interrested in AI due to absolutely loving any problem having to do with graphs. This paved the way to me working on ML for code. Through the years I have gained knowledge on using transformers and graph neural nets. Particulalrly I focus on the problem of generating code based on a human prompt which is library specific. I am presently looking for an internship or full time employment for when I finish my masters in mid spring. 

### Groups I'm in
I took over the ML4Code reading group at Mila for the year 2022-2023. We meet bi-weekly and if we don't have a special guest, we dicuss a paper that caught our eye. Over the summer I took a temporary position as the PGSS representative for the Computer Science Graduate Society (CSGS) at McGill. I helped out on various projects some social, some designing, and some administrative.

### Outside of work
As a true Montreal native, I play hockey once a week and enjoy watching the habs. Like many, during the covid quarantine I picked up extra hobies. However,  the only one to have really stuck is sewing. I enjoy tracing my own patterns and playing around tailoring ill-fitting clothes.
